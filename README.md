Guitar tab fan site devoted to The Church and their side projects

## From the original singsongs site

About 
Sing Songs is an unofficial, private site containing transcriptions and chords of songs by the Australian band The Church and other projects of the band’s members. 
It currently contains 189 songs.
It is maintained by Jens Berke and open for contributions, so if you have transcribed songs, found errors or have anything else to add to this site, please send them to me. You’ll find my email address on my homepage.

This file has originally been downloaded from http://www.singsongs.de, which may already contain a newer version and is also available in other formats there. 

The songs are organized into albums, solo projects, side projects and so on, as you can see in the table of contents. There’s also an alphabetically sorted list of songs at the end of the document. 

Some songs have more than one transcription. 

A lot of the transcriptions here were initially copied from Brian Smith’s website "Shadow Cabinet". 1
