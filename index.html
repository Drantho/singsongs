    Sing Songs is an unofficial, private site containing transcriptions and chords of songs by the Australian band The
    Church and other projects of the band’s members.
  </p>
  <p>
    It currently contains 189 songs.

  <p>
    It is maintained by Jens Berke and open for contributions, so if you have transcribed songs, found errors or have
    anything else to add to this site, please send them to me. You’ll find my email address on my homepage.

    This file has originally been downloaded from http://www.singsongs.de, which may already contain a newer version and
    is also available in other formats there.
  </p>
  <p>
    The songs are organized into albums, solo projects, side projects and so on, as you can see in the table of
    contents. There’s also an alphabetically sorted list of songs at the end of the document.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some songs have more than one transcription.

    For a Moment We’re Strangers

        (Kilbey) 
        [Em]In the empty place the soul stripped bare 
        Of skins and heart and I come a[G]part 
        In your icy [Bm]hands 
        I forget my [Am]role, [D]as I stare into your [C]soul 
        [Em]In the empty place you change your mind 
        You change your clothes you change your [G]pose 
        for a perfect [Bm]fit 
        I forget the [Am]cast, [D]as I stare into your [C]past 
        {soc} 
        [G]For a moment we're s[C]trangers 
        [G]For a minute you l[C]ook away 
        [G]For a second or [Em]always 
        [F]For an instant another [Em]day 
        [F]Such strange things you [Em]say 
        {eoc} 
        In the empty place we dress our wounds 
        Collect our coats, a window gloats 
        Above a street 
        I prepare my case, as I stare into your face 
        {c:Chorus} 
        Just one me one you 
        The world contains a few 
        Is it true, is it truly new 
        Are we through the stolen door once more

        So [C]hard finding inspi[F]ration 
        I knew you'd find me [C]crying 
        Tell those girls with [G]rifles for minds 
        That their [Em]jokes don't make me laugh 
        [F]They only make me feel like [C]dying 
        In an unguarded [F]moment [G] 
        So long, long between mirages 
        I knew you'd find me drinking 
        Tell those men with horses for hearts 
        That their jibes don't make me bleed 
        They only make me feel like shrinking 
        In an unguarded moment 
        {ci:Bridge, play 2 times} 
        [D] [A] [D] [A] [Bb] [C] 
        So deep, deep without a meaning 
        I knew you'd find me leaving 
        Tell those friends with cameras for eyes 
        That their hands don't make me hang 
        They only make me feel like breathing 
        In an unguarded moment 
        Drew James offers tab for the bridge of this great song. 
        I can offer at least the bridge to The Unguarded Moment. 
        Here it goes: (this is the part that Peter plays (at least on 
        Goldfish)) 
        E | 10-9----10-9----10-10----10----12----10 
        B | 10-10---10-10---11---11----11--13----11 
        G | 9-9-----9-9----10-----10------12----10 
        E | 10-9----10-9----10-------------12----10 
        B | 10-10---10-10---11-------------13----11 
        G | 9-9-----9-9----10-------------12----10 
        E | 10-9----10-9----10-------------12----13 
        B | 10-10---10-10---11-------------13----13 
        G | 9-9-----9-9----10-------------12----12 
        To get the timing right you really have to listen to the song 
        (duh) but you just keep playing the xxx(10)(11)(10) instead of 
        picking it the second and third times through. 
        Tab for solo transcribed by Russell Cook 25 Apr 1996: 
        This is my first go at tabing and I am going by memory 
        as I don't have the record available at the moment. At 
        least it's in the same key as the Chord transcription 
        below. Transcription is in 1/16 notes. A "." below a note is a dotted note.

        So down to the beach just out of reach 
        The moon was being trailed 
        A girl and a sailor and a hot dog trailer 
        That's their holy grail 
        The sand whispered heat and burned the feet 
        Of gulls landing on the shore 
        In the motel pool the waitress cools 
        She doesn't ask for more 
        She makes a wish she takes a risk 
        She opens up her door 
        Through human eyes she's a dolphin in disguise 
        It's the last night of the war 
        Somewhere far away there's another day 
        And someone's getting out of bed 
        She put on her face in the morning space 
        She doesn't know she's dead 
        Her [G]ruby lips can't [F]excite me any[C]more 
        And [Dm]pain sprawls on the [F]chair, it's always [C]there 
        And [Dm]he descends the [F]stairs, he doesn't [C]see 
        The [Dm]sunburnt landlord [F]glares, for all the [C]people [Dm] 
        He can [F]never be [C] [Dm]

        [D]Oceanic lights are cleverly dim 
        Blueish features in the lower reaches 
        We raise out traffic flares to him 
        Fishnet, girlish the red ones spark 
        Holy arcs tracked in the dark 
        The more I see the less I look 
        Here's another name I took 
        Listen! In the early morning air 
        The remnants of their evening wear 
        Branching off, the road winds east 
        Deluxe locations just near completion 
        Come dine with wine and oyster feast 
        The pearls are real, have one for free 
        They're washed up by the foam waved sea

        Never mind let's stay awhile

        Why desert just to be alone

        [G]Is this where you [D]live 
        [D]Don't blush as I brush your touch 
        No need for any speed or rush 
        [F]All you own is on the floor 
        [D]I'm buying all you're gonna give 
        [G]Is this where you [D]live

        Electric lights don't help my youth

      Tabbed by Andy Perks 
      Andy says: 
      I have done the solo in tablature form - it is almost the same as the solo from the other transcription down below but there are a couple of variations. It shows the double-notes towards the end of the solo and I use a slightly different set of chords - I’ve shown the chord changes where I make them when playing it. Also, during the verse, I use a G instead of one of the Em chords.

      When You Were Mine 
      (Kilbey) 
      [A]On a day like this[Bm], [G]a hundred [A]lifetimes ago [Bm] [G] 
      [A]You on a shore, [G]across the point 
      I [F#m]looked through my hands and you [F]drew me a [Esus4]line [E] 
      When you were [A]mine [Bm] [G] 
      On a world like this, a hunderd turns left to go 
      Deep in a room, which I've never seen 
      Outside it's so cold but I'm waiting for time 
      When you were mine 
      {soc} 
      [Bbm]Plenty of [Ab]islands bet[Bbm]ween now and [Ab]then 
      [Bbm]Rocks break the [Ab]boats of the [Bbm]painted face [Ab]men 
      And they [F#]drown, and they're [F]born 
      And they [F#]live once [F]again 
      [F#]And this all [Ab]happens 
      [F]When you were mine [A] [Bm] [G] 
      {eoc} 
      In a storm like this, a hundred kisses of snow 
      You with another so easily sleep 
      What's real and what's dreamt become close and entwine 
      When you were [B]mine [C#m] [A]

      [F9]It's a long way home from the [C]Field of Mars [F]Distant, alone, beneath the [C]platimun stars [G]And I turn to look, but I'm [F]never any closer [G]Only just the rain [F]makes the skin feel colder ||:[Am]All my life seems so [G]far away:|| 
      The air is soft in the Field of Mars 
      Tears and loss feed the overgrown grass 
      And I have to leave, but I never seem to go Only more sad clouds where autumn winds will blow All my dreams seem so long ago 
      {soc} 
      ||:[C]Oh, [F]Field of Mars :|| 
      {eoc} 
      Time is past in the Field of Mars 
      Grief won't last in the departing cars 
      And I call her name, but she never, ever hears And I call again to the cruelty of the years Oh my love she's so far away

      "They're [A9]going to send you [E]away" she said [A9]Psychic angels spread on the [E]top of her head And [A9]in the compartments [E]of my dread The [A9]rush hour crush travels home to [E]bed 
      "You never seem to hear" she smiled 
      Statues tiptoe for a glimpse of the child The lawns are always lush and wild 
      Spacious floors bejewelled and tiled 
      "How are you getting home" she laughed 
      Mermaids drowned but I clung to the raft It's just the water in the bath

      [C]Lying alone, [G]isn't that you

      Is the [Am]only thing [G]left to do 
      [C]Such a sad place, [G]such a lost world 
      But [F9]nothing is sadder 
      Than the [Am]tears of a [G]make-believe [F]girl [G] 
      Who is this child, who is this man 
      Only two people 
      Who are doing all they can 
      Frost on the ground, the cruel winds of fate 
      Blow us forever 
      And I know there's just no escape 
      [Am]Run to the secret corners [E]of your room 
      I'll still be [G]waiting

        Gathering speed, Paying no heed

        Oh..........just for you (repeat and fade) 
        NOW... some of the chords are marked thus*. That means there are two different chords being alternated between quickly (listen to the track for where the changes are): 
        D* is between D x00232 and Dsus4 x00233 (sometimes D+2 x00230 is thrown in too!) 
        G* is between G 320033 and G6 320030 
        A7sus4* is between A7sus4 002033 and a different A7sus4 002030, and 
        sometimes good ol' A7 002020 
        A/Eb is played x01220 (and sounds pretty horrible! The Church play it with Steve hitting an Eb on the bass as Marty (?) plays an A) 
        Two guitars share lead duty in the instrumental (A A/Eb etc) bridge

        [G]Night-time is so lonely 
        When you hear a sound 
        But it's only an empty [CM7]heart 
        Beating on through the night 
        A sad sad drum 
        And I'm [G]lying here listening 
        And the raindrops are all glistening

        And I'm waking to this aching 
        And it's breaking me in two 
        All the space 
        All the waste 
        All the distance between me and you 
        And the people with their voices 
        Random choices will they ever learn

        Really be on fire when their spirit burns 
        {soc}

        So I'm waiting, contemplating 
        Relocating a faded image in my thoughts 
        But the memories are like clouds 
        Try so hard 
        But they never can be caught 
        But I'm trying, yes I'm trying 
        But I'm only lying in the dark 
        So alone 
        On my own 
        No one home 
        {soc} 
        And if love was worth a fortune 
        Then I'd need a rise 
        To be in your eyes 
        I want these words to be the things 
        I hoped you'd realised

        slides and bends are both written with \ and / characters. listen to the song to work out which. 
        caret's indicate a harmonic. 
        the spaces between notes sorta says how the rythym goes, but there is not really any separation except bars, and that might even be dodgy.

        A Different Man 
        (Kilbey) 
        Transcribed by James Dignan 
        (Brian Smith put the E minor into the verse) 
        D D/C# GMaj7/B G * 
        Gmaj7/B can also be called Bmsus4, played x20032 
        *on this intro and the chorus, the lead guitar just alternates between D and G, but I think there's also rhythm (or just a "feel", using the bass 
        somehow, of a progression through D, Asus, Bm and G. See the Tab (!) below. 
        [A]Inside himself, He [Em]runs to look in the [G]mirror 
        [A]And the face that stares right back has [Em]never been any [G]clearer [A]But look at the doubt in his eyes [Bm]He's not the one to [C]blame 
        D D/C# GMaj7/B 
        It was a different man, no he's never been here 
        G D 
        You can be so close, you can be so near 
        D/C# GMaj7/B 
        It was a different man, playing different cards 
        G D (overlaps start of verse) 
        You can be so soft, you can be so hard 
        Inside himself, He follows the wrong directions 
        Perfect English words all right But with the wrong inflections 
        But look at the dust at his feet He's not the one she loves 
        It was a different man, no he's never been found 
        You can be so up, you can be so down 
        It was a different man, no he's never been there 
        You can be halfway, you can be all there (repeat first chorus) 
        Instrumental bit 
        D D/C# G/B G 
        G Em C D 
        Em F G 
        G G/F# CMaj7/E C 
        (NB:this last line is simply the intro transposed one key flat around the chord cycle. I'm not sure of the Em in the second line, but I can't think what else it might be) 
        Inside himself, He thinks that he looks the same 
        And the mind that thinks it all out Never noticed any change 
        But look at the doubt in his eyes He's not the one to blame 
        And here's the guitar tab for the intro etc...

        [D]Tell me, [Em]is everything unplanned? 
        [G]It's all so unexpected that I [D]just can't understand We [D]run so hard and always end up [em]in the same place [G]"Glad that went so smoothly" well that [D]never is the case 
        [G]One day - [D]doubtless, cloudless, bright 
        [G]We'll shake away the shadows [D]of eternal night [C]It's just the storm before the calm 
        [G]Like the life held in your palm - it's [Asus4]clay, one [D]day 
        And you stand there, with ashes blowing past 
        Dipping into gilt-edged love that will be made at last And the gold you spend and the hastening end 
        That you throw into the sea 
        Coming back a hundredfold, there's no guarantee 
        {c:Chorus} 
        We'll walk and be like giants, we'll all be honest men I go back to my blindness so that I may see again 
        A woman standing on a hill is gazing out to sea 
        Dreaming of a new age waiting there for me 
        I call her from a distance and she smiles into the sun And men and gods begin their dance, for their time has begun And holy wars extended and battlefields of pain 
        Washed away, forgotten in the perfect rain 
        Princes, kings and humble things are well-worn and content Messengers come everywhere, envoys have been sent 
        (Na na na .... a palm tree nodded at me last night he said, "Hey you look so pale")

        Look over my shoulder and I say hey hey

        This is the world that I once called home 
        Strangers in their naked skin 
        Waiting for their sweet oblivion 
        Close to you, hear all you say 
        Even though you're continents away 
        The perfumed air, the taste of fear 
        Shrug your shoulders and they disappear

        For the more proficient :), there are several picking parts, notably the intro/ending, where there are two guitars: 
        |------------------|------------------| 
        |------------------|------------------| 
        |---0---0---0---0--|---0---0---0---0--| 
        |--0---0-0-0---0-0-|--0---0-0-0---0-0-| 
        |-----2---3---2----|-----2---3--------| 
        |-3----------------|-3-----------3----| 
        and 
        |-----0-------3----|-----0------------| 
        |-013--310-13------|-013--310-13------| 
        |------------------|-------------0----| 
        |------------------|------------------| 
        |------------------|------------------| 
        |------------------|------------------| 
        Then the bridge part, (chords F C G) which has a slidey part ( an equals sign here means slide to the second note...Frets are numbered in hexadecimal, so A=10, B=11 etc) 
        |-3=A-9=A-9=A-3-|-3=5-3=5--------| 
        |---------------|---------5=8----| 
        |---------------|----------------| 
        |---------------|----------------| 
        |---------------|----------------| 
        |---------------|----------------| 
        Then back to the G, Gsus pattern for a frightening lead part (done on 12-string, so this is only approximate) 
        |----------03-7----|-CA8A87-ZZZ-3=F---| 
        |-------013---8----|----------------h-| 
        |-----02------9----|----------------h-| 
        |---02-------------|------------------| 
        |-23---------------|------------------| 
        |------------------|------------------| 
        ZZZ is a trill played on the 10th, 8th and 7th frets somehow, possibly with the 2nd and 3rd strings in there too. The slide goes up from the 3rd to the 15th fret, and is followed by 5th fret harmonics on the 2nd and 3rd 
        strings. OK, I admit it MWP is a bloody good 12-string player! Good luck!!!

        The same pattern continues for the other verses: 
        Walking outside you come to a door 
        You go inside and you wonder what for 
        At least it's good to be out of the wind 
        You turn around and the clocks all begin 
        Just like the winter your memory thaws 
        Just like the ocean your memory pours 
        So many pieces to match or to find 
        So many doubts to have in one mind 
        It's hard to see how the tables have turned 
        It's hard to see how the people have learned 
        It's hard to watch the past drizzling past 
        It's hard to watch them picking the cast 
        And it stacks up badly that it never makes sense You sense that sensation is who's paying the rent And she beckons to you with her fingers and lies She says: can't you slice the price of your paradise 
        The sliding lead break in the second and third verses is: 
        |-----------------| 
        |-3=>5------------| 
        |------2=>4-------| repeated

        6th August 97 - Brian Smith 
        Here's my interpretation of this song. It's a bit more complex than the chord-based one which follows it. 
        There seems to be a lot of ways to play this song. When I've seen Steve play it live he goes for a simplified version of the following arrangment, which sounds much like the acoustic performances he and Marty do when sharing the stage. 
        Chords (strings numbered from low E to high E) 
        D - 000232 
        D9 - 000230 
        G6 - 320000 
        Em7 - 022030 
        D9/F# - 200230 
        A7sus4 - X02030 (try and avoid the low E, but no probs if you can't) F#m - 244222 (like Em, barre second fret) 
        F#m/A - X04222 This one's a bit awkward to play - avoid the low E Fmaj7 - X03210 
        Em/A - X05430 Just slide up two frets from Fmaj7 
        "Here in this desert"... 
        D G6 (repeat till chorus) 
        OR D Em7 D9/F# G6 
        "A gunfight in Dodge City..." 
        F#m G F#m/A (if you can, otherwise repeat the first chord) 
        "All my life spent searching..." 
        Fmaj7 Em/A D - For that second chord just slide up two frets from the   first. Let the A string ring if, or block it if you   don't like the sound. 
        Here’s a simpler, chord-based version. 
        [D]Here in this [Em7]desert, be[F#m ?]neath the sun and [G]stars 
        Still troubled by the rumblings of a million distant cars 
        Please be good to me tonight, let me find my way 
        The air has some command in it I cannot disobey 
        [F#m]A gunfight in Dodge [G]City, a [D]murder in Bom[G]bay 
        [F#m]All these deeds and [G]worldly needs I [D]must shrug off to[G]day [Fmaj7]All my life spent [Em7]searching for pro[D]wess 
        [Fmaj7]Left me lying [Em7]here with you, tris[D]tesse 
        I was working in an orchard that grew the strangest fruit 
        It wasn't Mother Nature that made those trees take root 
        Your children cannot hear you, they only want your loot 
        You hold on to their essence like a parachute 
        They never believed you were in distress 
        Now you've gone and left them with tristesse

        [D]Ah, [G]fires burnt [A]out [G]

        The voice is a-calling and it can't be ignored

        You might be underground but you're over insured

        Transcribed by Brian Smith 
        This is the most well-known Church song and (as luck would have it) one of the easiest to play. 
        Am7sus4 is played as follows 
        E 0 
        B 3 
        G 0 
        D 2 
        A 0 
        E X 
        Verse: Am Am7sus4 Fmaj7 G 
        Chorus: G Fmaj7 
        Bridge/Solo: C G Am 
        Extra Credit: 
        If you have a friend with a capo, get them to put it on the fifth fret and play: Verse: Em Em7sus4 Cmaj7 D 
        Chorus: D Cmaj7 
        Bridge/Solo: G D Em 
        That will really thicken the sound up. Vary your respective rhythms for even more effect.

        That last "A" leaves you holding an Am7sus4 (or A7sus4, whatever you want to call it.) Play each note in a Church-y manner, then repeat once more. Then cue Marty going bonkers on his Rickenbacker playing a descending Em pentatonic

        Use a delay time of about 350 milliseconds for the first part. 
        There are two guitars in the song. The first one goes with the delay, while the second one has a light distortion.

        And here are the bass tabs:

        A------10---10-12------------------13-------10----- 
        E-------------------------------------------------- 
        The last note of the run, G(10th fret A string), sometimes does a small slide downward. 
        Chorus is just a G - F - Eb progression that can be played 
        10th fret 8th fret 6th fret on the A string 
        or 5th fret 3rd fret 1st fret on the D string.

    This is a great song to play solo 
    Opening strum: D Em7 C9 rpt 
    Verse: D Am7sus4 C9 (X4) 
    Chorus: Em C9 G 
    Bridge: My favourite part. Make the shape of Fmaj7 (F chord with open high E) Then move your hand up the neck so your index finger is on the fifth fret. This is an open A chord. The chords you'll play are: A C/A D9/A Bbaug4/A. But they're all the same chord shape, with the index finger on these frets: 5, then 8 then 10 then 6. Get it ? 
    The bridge section gets repeated a few times, so start softly, then build in volume and complexity so that by the last time your hand is a blur and the amp is screeching !

    Result of transcriptions by Jens Berke and Scott Jobson 
    The intro is Dm picked in the following way 
    ---1---0---1---3-1- 
    ----3---3---3------ 
    --2---2---2---2---- 
    -0---0---0---0----- 
    ------------------- 
    ------------------- 
    Verse: 
    From Scott: 
    verses: Dm Dm/C A#maj7 Am 
    choruses: Gm Am A# C 
    if you are playing this song by yourself (as so many of us bedroom performers do) you might want to play the full chords as listed for the chorus. for the pedants, you will notice that on the recording, these are played as simple power chords. 
    Dm xx0231 
    Dm/C x30231 
    A#maj7 x13231 or x1323x (if yr lazy like me) 
    Am x02210 
    Brian also suggests playing Asus4 for the first two beats of the Am chord...and it works for me, so here's the chord along with my thanks to Brian for the corrections. 
    Asus4 x02230 

    Jens has a similar suggestion for the verse:
    Dm [xx0231]
    Dm4 [xx0233]
    Dsus2/A# [x10230]
    A7sus4 [x02030]
    Cadd9 [x32030]
    Dm Dm4 Cadd9 Dsus2/A#
    The wine in your hand is worth
    A7sus4 Cadd9
    two at the bar
    And so on. It sounds much better if you do some picking with these chords.
    Chorus:
    Gm (full chord) 355333 or G5 (power chord) 355xxx
    Am (full chord) x02210 or A5 (power chord) x022xx
    A# (full chord) x13331 or A#5 (power chord) x13300
    C (full chord) x32010 or C5 (power chord) x355xx

    SOLO
    this solo isn't too hard, just alot of work to transcribe, so just
    try noodling around in the key of D minor... Marty seems to use
    alot of descending runs in this solo (which also features a delay,
    or echo, effect throughout).
